Seismic wave inversion plays an important role in seismic exploration. 
With the increasing of seismic data, 
it is necessary to extract useful information from massive data more quickly and accurately. 
This method is devoted to exploring an artificial intelligence method to identify the time window of seismic waveform, 
providing a reliable and effective research sample window for seismic inversion.
